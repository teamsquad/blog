title: The master plan

As you may have noticed teamsquad hasn't launched yet so its currently vapourware. It won't always be so. There is actually a plan to get the thing public so you can get your grubby mitts on it.

Development effort is going to be picking up. Once the site has been brought kicking and screaming into the modern world it will be given to a few lucky souls to play with. Assuming that goes well it will be opened up to public testing. From there a proper launch awaits.

If you organise a local and/or amateur sports league and would like to be involved in testing the site then get in touch.
